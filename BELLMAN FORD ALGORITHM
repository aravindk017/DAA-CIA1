QUESTION: TO SOLVE THE MENTIONED DIAGRAM AND FIND THE MINIMUM SPANNING TREE USING BELLMAN FORD ALGORITHM

ADJACECNY MATRIX:
[0 4 2 0 0]
[4 0 3 2 3]
[2 1 0 4 5]
[0 0 0 0 0]
[0 0 0 -5 0]

For the following diagram, teh basic prim's and kruskal's algorithm cannot be applied because it is directed and had a negative edge of -5.
Hence, for directed graphs, Dijkstra's algorithm will be applied where we can determine and alter the distance of each vertex,where:
distance of one vertex(u) + edge of the vertices(u,v) < distance of vertex(v)
Then, distance of vertex v = distance of vertex(u) +edge of the vertices(u,v)

d(u) + c(u,v) < d(v)
then d(v)= d(u)+ c(u,v)

After evaluating the formula:

VERTEX | DISTANCE
A         0
B         3
C         2
D         5
E         6
